**This is a code sample for applying for Research Analyst in the Education Lab**

This code sample is a part of my thesis project, which tends to explore how adults' emotional facial expressions will affect children's learning motivation towards a specific subject. All the data in this sample was randomly assigned to different IDs to protect participantsâ€˜ privacy, which will not be conducted in the real analysis. This code sample includes 1 table, 2 graphs (one violin plot and one smooth plot), extracted value references, in-line functions, in-text BibTeX citations, and other codes and functions I've mastered. It also includes a writing sample of the literature review and the methodology.
